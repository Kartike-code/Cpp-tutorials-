// *********************BASIC STRUCTURE OF A C++ PROGRAM****************************

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<<"Hello World";
    return 0;
}

/*1. In the above code "#include<iostream>"" is the name of a header file wherein iostream is a library
which helps us to get input data and show output data. And because of this file we can use 
functions like cout, cin, etc.
2. "using namespace std" means that we are using the standard namespace library of the iostream library
to execute cout function.
3. "int" is a return type which means an "integer" and "main()" is a function that is a primary function
which helps to call other functions like "cout" and "cin", etc. "()" denotes that it is function.
4. Anything which is written in double quotations represents that it is a string.
5. The importance of "return 0" is that the keyword "return" will return a 0 value as an integer to the
main function.*/
